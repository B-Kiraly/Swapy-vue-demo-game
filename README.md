# Drag n Drop Vue Demo (Swapy)

## Todo

-Replace Dice.vue code with DiceTwo.vue's code, as it's basically just an improved version of it at this point
-Better safeguarding against colliding Swapy IDs for slots and items
-Expand on the dice demo (Delete dice, etc)
-Figure out why swapy localstorage for component positions is no longer working
